# Classwork

- Review any notes / lessons from this week that you aren't clear on

We will also be creating a group project with everything we've learned so far. This doesn't need to be complex, but it should at least have the following:

- Use of an external API that can be searched / queried by a user
- At least 3 routes including the ability to login (sign up is optional)
- State management across the application
- On the search page, the user should be able to keep the last thing searched for in tact if they navigate away and back to the search component
- Proper structure of the application to allow for reusable hooks / components / etc.
- Proper branching whether it is worked on as together or split up into pieces for different members to work on.
